Freedom Tub
Hydrotherapy is comprised of three main benefits:
Heat, Massage, and Buoyancy.
Heat from the warm water increases blood flow to
produce a healing affect on sore and damaged
tissue and relaxes tired muscles and joints
Massage from Air and Water jets relaxes tight muscles
and stimulates the release of endorphins,
the body’s natural pain killers
Buoyancy from the water reduces body weight
by approximately 90%, relieving pressure
from your joints and muscles
The three most
common ailments
people use
hydrotherapy
to treat are:

ANOTHER
